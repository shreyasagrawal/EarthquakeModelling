Predictive Models for Math Assessment Proficiency and Reading Assessment Proficiency in Iowa K-12 Schools

Proficiency assessments are utilized in schools to test studentâ€™s competency in specific skills, but there has been previous 
research showing that proficiency scores are correlated with factors like poverty. If so, it is important to recognize that 
these factors exist so that I can find a way to reduce their influence on student success. In this project, I seek to make models 
using multiple regression and random forests that could predict the percentage of 8th-grade students who were proficient in math and 
reading assessments in Iowa public schools. I found that in general, our models were not great at predicting the percentage of students 
that would be proficient in assessments, with low R^2 values and relatively high RMSE values. I did find that economic variables and 
demographics had some importance in determining assessment proficiency, but our models cannot really be applied more widely, and our 
data has limitations.
